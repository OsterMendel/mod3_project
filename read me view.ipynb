    "\n",
    "The goal for this project is to determine what leads customers astray and to predict if a customer will leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A look inside\n",
    "In this dataset we have a churn rate close of approx 15%\n",

    "Five states with highest churn rate\n",
    "<img src=\"graphs_and_images/top_five_states_by_churnRate.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn rate is higher for customers with a international plan. Roughly 10% of customers use this feature.\n",
    "<img src=\"graphs_and_images/churn_by_intl_plan.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of Total charges is different for the churned customers as viewed here.\n",
    "It seems that customers who pay more than 80 are more liklely to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"graphs_and_images/pdf_total_charges.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of customers who leave us is greater than those who don't for the subset of customers who call customer service more than 4 times\n",
    "<img src=\"graphs_and_images/pdf_customer_service_calls.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset has a significant amount of class imbalance I used SMOTE to create synthetic samples of the smaller class (customers who left)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitted models include:\n",
    ">Logistic Regression<br>\n",
    "KNN<br>\n",
    "Decision Tree<br>\n",
    "SVC<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "with decision tree and svc coming in first\n",
    "\n",
    "I applied a gridsearch using decision tree and got a slightly better score. Ensemble method Random forest came in higher, so I did a grid search over that which improved my score.<br>\n",
    "Finally I applied a Xgboost classifier which gets the top score.\n",
    "Here are the contributing features.\n",
    "<img src=\"graphs_and_images/feature_importance_xgboost.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a summary of the models and their scores \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model can predict 82% of \n",
    "The length of calls is the greatest influence on our predictions. This leads me wondering whether there is some level of service interruption. Moving forward we should collect data on dropped calls and overall call quality. Additionally, we need to be more careful with our customer service, it would be wise to add a feature including the reason for their call.\n",
